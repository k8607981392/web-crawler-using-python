I have built a simple search engine using python. This search engine, returns the list of url's that contain a specific keyword in the pages the engine had crawled till then. So, in the main function, we first let the function crawl, giving a specific url as seed, forming an index. Then we go for looking the word entered to search in the index (We can search for any keyword). The Look_up function helps us in our later task returning a list of urls that contain our keyword. 
 The ability to search a specific web site for the page you are looking for is a very useful feature. However, searching can be complicated and providing a good search experience can require knowledge of multiple programming languages. This project will demonstrate a simple search engine you can run in your own site. This project is also a good introduction to the Python programming language. You can run this project on any server which supports CGI and has Python installed. This project was tested with Python version 2.7.
